############README populate.pl perl csv ldap conversion script

USAGE: 
1. create spreadsheet with the following fields: 
action*, country, businesunit, default gateway, network ip, remotename, city, state, ipaddress, unique identifier, server brand, server Model, build version 

*action can be: ADD or DELETE case sensitive. 

2. export as csv. 

3. run populate.pl <file.csv>
   Note that the command can take multiple files as arguments and will work through each. 

4. When deleting and adding LDAP entries, the script will generate /tmp/<timestamp>_<csvfilename>_[ " " || DELETE].ldiff file based on the actions: add or delete.

5. if there is a problem re-import the backups using the following procedure:
 
 -find latest pre-delete backup: 
   ls -lrt /tmp/*.ldif

 -re-apply using ldapmodify (requires the openldap-clients rpm):  
  ldapmodify -F -v -a -0 -D 'cn=Manager,dc=mydomain,dc=com' -w - -f /tmp/2009-05-30_02-47_.ldif
 
N.B. For large imports, it may be best to comment the Entry 'print' block to 
suppress console output for every LDAP action.
