cgi script to populate host variables based on example
provided by Aram Kananov.

Installation: 
copy script to /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory of suitable web server. 
if this is not the same host as the LDAP server change 'localhost' in the 
following line to represent LDAP server hostname: 

con = ldap.initialize('ldap://localhost')

script can be called in pre section of kickstart system.
resulting host information can then be sourced to set
host specific kickstart variables.

 usage:
 wget -c -O /tmp/hostdetails http://<ldap_server>/cgi-bin/gethostdetails.py?servername=<unique_servername_cn>

 e.g:
 the following run on the installing host will get host details for consta and save in /tmp/hostdetails
 wget -c -O /tmp/hostdetails http://localhost/cgi-bin/gethostdetails.py?servername=consta

TEST this script by using the default configuration: 
./gethostdetails.py servername=liberd

ADDED a virtinstall cgi script to create virt install commands based on ldap entries
