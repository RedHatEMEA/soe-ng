copy rh.schema to /etc/openldap/schema
mkdir /var/lb/rh
chown ldap.ldap /var/lib/rh

which creates objectClass entry using slapadd command and rh-detailed.ldiff 

commands are detailed in ./data/setup.sh file to add and test objectclasses to ldap instance. 

start ldap database and check with /usr/lib/mozldap/ldapsearch (requires the mosldap-tools rpm) examples in /data/setup.sh
